# Data Structures Implementation in C++

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++ for the Data Structures course (Level 2, Term 1) at Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET). These implementations serve both as course assignments and learning resources.

## Data Structures Included

Currently, this repository includes:
- Singly Linked List (`singly_linked_list.cpp`)

## Course Information

- **Institution**: Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET)
- **Course**: Data Structures
- **Level**: 2
- **Term**: 1

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (GCC/G++ recommended)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming
- Understanding of data structure concepts

## How to Compile and Run

To compile any of the programs, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -o output_name source_file.cpp
```

For example, to compile the singly linked list implementation:
```bash
g++ -o singly_linked_list singly_linked_list.cpp
```

To run the compiled program:
```bash
./singly_linked_list
```

## Structure Overview

Each implementation file contains:
- Class definition of the data structure
- Basic operations implementation
- Main function with usage examples
